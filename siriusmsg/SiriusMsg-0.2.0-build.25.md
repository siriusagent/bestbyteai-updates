# SiriusMsg 0.2.0 (build 25)

[Download the branded SiriusMsg installer](https://github.com/siriusagent/siriusmsg/releases/download/v0.2.0-build.25/SiriusMsg-0.2.0-build.25-installer.zip), extract the ZIP, open the DMG, then drag SiriusMsg to Applications.

- Add the native Sirius connection through Sirius's app-owned ACP service. Connect from SiriusMsg and approve access in Sirius's Connected Apps settings. Upgrading the previous channel preserves conversation identities, chat permissions and retained review history.
- Keep new messages and replies moving after an earlier turn needs review. Back-to-back messages queue for the existing conversation; the uncertain original message is retained without automatically repeating its work or reply. This covers Codex and the shared Claude, OpenCode, Hermes, Pi and OpenClaw delivery paths.
- Show one Sirius connection after migration, retain access to previous review items, and keep unrelated connections and their activity separate.
- Present Markdown replies as readable Messages text, with clean bullets and usable links. Optional native formatting requires a ready, explicitly enabled provider.
- Preserve accepted replies with their original connection when the answering agent changes, and improve ACP transport and durable attachment handling.

This remains an alpha release. Native Sirius setup requires a compatible Sirius app and its normal approval and migration flow; updating SiriusMsg alone does not approve a new connection. SwiftPython remains 0.7.0 with Python 3.13.17 and Sparkle remains 2.10.0. Recipient-visible typing indicators and automatic recovery of review items after late send confirmation remain unavailable. This release does not newly qualify the complete live Messages/provider and recovery matrix.
