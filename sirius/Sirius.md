# Sirius v0.1.0-alpha.55

**Strict pre-release unstable build.** This alpha exists for early installation,
packaging, and Sparkle update testing. It is not an RC, production release,
compatibility promise, or support boundary.

## Changes

- **Emergency session-start bridge hotfix.** Cold terminal and browser host
  bridge registration is now coalesced before session construction snapshots
  bridge topology. Fresh launches no longer fail with
  `Bridge topology changed while building the session` when terminal and
  browser callbacks legitimately register back-to-back.

## Distribution

- Signed with Developer ID.
- Notarized and stapled.
- Sparkle public key, signed appcast, and signed core-runtime update feed are
  enabled for alpha update testing.
